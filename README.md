I created this to transform interviews that we have in our experiemnts into .txt file!

the code is adapted from following article:
![Transcribing interview data from video to text with Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/transcribing-interview-data-from-video-to-text-with-python-5cdb6689eea1)

However, I also added several features to enance its applicablity!
